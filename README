This project will be a simple scraper that extracts the titles and links of articles from a blog or news site.

1. Initial Setup
First, project for the scraper:

mkdir web_scraper
cd web_scraper

Explanations and Customizations
HTTP Request: The scraper uses HTTParty to make a GET request to the specified URL.

HTML Parsing with Nokogiri:

Nokogiri::HTML(response.body) parses the HTML content returned by the request.
The css('article') method selects the article elements from the page. You can change the CSS selector to match the specific structure of the site you want to scrape.
Data Extraction:

article.css('h2').text.strip: Extracts the text from the h2 element within each article, which is assumed to be the title.
article.css('a').attribute('href')&.value: Extracts the href attribute from the link within the article.
